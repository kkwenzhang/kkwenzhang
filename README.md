## Hi there 👋, I'm Wen Zhang.

I am a Research Assistant in the Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, at Johns Hopkins University, advised by Prof. Andreia Faria. I am also a Research Intern at Stony Brook University, working with Prof. Chenyu You.

✨ I received my M.S.E. in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 2025 and my bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from Sichuan University in 2023.

🤔 I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position for Fall 2026. My research focuses on developing AI systems that harness biomedical data to improve clinical decision-making, accelerate scientific discovery, and bridge the gap between computational innovation and healthcare practice.

🌱 I welcome discussions and collaborations in AI for healthcare and science. Feel free to reach out if our research interests align.
